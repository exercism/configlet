# Configlet for Exercism v3

This is a development version of Configlet for use with v3 of Exercism.

## Usage

The application is a single binary and can be used as follows:

```
Usage:
  configlet [global-options] <command> [command-options]

Commands:
  sync, uuid

Options for sync:
  -e, --exercise <slug>        Only sync this exercise
  -c, --check                  Terminates with a non-zero exit code if one or more tests are missing. Doesn't update the tests
  -m, --mode <mode>            What to do with missing test cases. Allowed values: c[hoose], i[nclude], e[xclude]
  -p, --prob-specs-dir <dir>   Use this `problem-specifications` directory, rather than cloning temporarily
  -o, --offline                Do not check that the directory specified by `-p, --prob-specs-dir` is up-to-date

Options for uuid:
  -n, --num <int>              Number of UUIDs to generate

Global options:
  -h, --help                   Show this help message and exit
      --version                Show this tool's version information and exit
  -t, --track-dir <dir>        Specify a track directory to use instead of the current directory
  -v, --verbosity <verbosity>  The verbosity of output. Allowed values: q[uiet], n[ormal], d[etailed]
```

## Linting

The primary function of configlet is to do _linting_: checking if a track's configuration files are properly structured - both syntactically and semantically. Misconfigured tracks may not sync correctly, may look wrong on the website, or may present a suboptimal user experience, so configlet's guards play an important part in maintaining the integrity of Exercism. The full list of rules that are checked by the linter can be found [here](https://github.com/exercism/v3-docs/blob/master/anatomy/tracks/configlet/linting.md).

The `configlet lint` command is currently in the process of being implemented.

## Sync

If a track implements an exercise for which test data exists in the [problem-specifications repo](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications), the exercise _must_ contain a `.meta/tests.toml` file. The goal of the `tests.toml` file is to keep track of which tests are implemented by the exercise. Tests in this file are identified by their UUID and each test has a boolean value that indicates if it is implemented by that exercise.

A `tests.toml` file for a track's `two-fer` exercise looks like this:

```toml
[canonical-tests]
# no name given
"19709124-b82e-4e86-a722-9e5c5ebf3952" = true
# a name given
"3451eebd-123f-4256-b667-7b109affce32" = true
# another name given
"653611c6-be9f-4935-ab42-978e25fe9a10" = false
```

In this case, the track has chosen to implement two of the three available tests. If a track uses a _test generator_ to generate an exercise's test suite, it _must_ use the contents of the `tests.toml` file to determine which tests to include in the generated test suite.

The `configlet sync` command allows tracks to keep `tests.toml` files up to date. The command will compare the tests specified in the `tests.toml` files against the tests that are defined in the exercise's canonical data. It will then prompt the user to choose whether to include or exclude missing tests, and update the `tests.toml` files accordingly. If you only want a quick check, you can use the `--check` option.

The `configlet sync` command replaces the functionality of the older `canonical_data_syncer` application.

## Use in your track

To use the application in your track, you can copy the [`scripts/fetch-configlet`](./scripts/fetch-configlet) and/or [`scripts/fetch-configlet.ps1`](./scripts/fetch-configlet.ps1) files to your track's repository. Running either of these scripts will download the latest version of the `configlet` tool to your track's `bin` directory.
