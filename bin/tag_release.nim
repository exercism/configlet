## Running this file will:
## 1. Switch to the `main` branch, if there are no uncommitted changes (exiting
##    otherwise).
## 2. Pull the upstream `main` branch from github.com/exercism/configlet.
## 3. Check that the local `main` branch is not ahead of upstream.
## 4. Check that the most recent commit on the `main` branch is an untagged
##    release commit.
## 5. Prompt the user to tag the commit and push the tag to exercism/configlet,
##    which will trigger a build job and create a draft release.
