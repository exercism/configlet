# To make Nimble use the pinned `isaac` version, we must pin `isaac` after `uuids`
# (which has `isaac` as a dependency).
# Nimble still clones the latest `isaac` tag if there is no tag-versioned one
# on-disk (e.g. at ~/.nimble/pkgs/isaac-0.1.3), and adds it to the path when
# building, but (due to writing it later) the pinned version takes precedence.
# Nimble will support lock files in the future, which should provide more robust
# version pinning.
